## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my first time using TypeScript so I learnt alot about declaring value types. I had trouble at first declaring react components types and other TypeScript declarations.
I reinforced my knowledge of React and Styled Components and have tried different ways of using them compared to my past projects.

### Continued development

As this was my first time using TypeScript there are still alot of things about TypeScript I haven't completely mastered.
Some things I'd like to improve in the future are:
- Declarations
- Interfaces
- Types
- Best Practices

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with everything. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, this is a great resource for every developer.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Great resource for seeing examples.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
